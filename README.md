# Employee Data Analysis
Employee database is a database containing tables. 

1. Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and 
female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

2. Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, 
and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.

3. Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two 
values the user can insert when calling the procedure.

4. Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different 
departments for each year, starting from 1990.
